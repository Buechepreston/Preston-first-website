			<td>I’m a 20-year-old college student at Michigan State University, majoring in Advertising Management with a minor in Business.
			I’m a passionate sports fan, especially of the Detroit Lions, Detroit Tigers, Michigan State Spartans, and Los Angeles Lakers.
			I enjoy spending time in public spaces, meeting new people, and connecting through activities like pick-up basketball games.
			Outside of sports, I have a strong love for learning and enjoy picking up new skills, whether it’s coding or taking classes like real estate.</td><br>
